**Real Estate Listings Scraper and Analysis Dashboard**

Description: Create a web scraper that extracts property listings from real estate sites (e.g., location, price, number of rooms, etc.) and stores them in a SQL database.

Use Pandas to create reports on trends such as average prices by location, price per square meter, etc., and visualize them in a simple dashboard.

**Steps:**

1. Scrape real estate listings using Scrapy
2. Store the data in a SQL database, organizing by key fields like price, location, and property size.
3. Use Pandas to clean and analyze the data, such as calculating average prices or showing trends over time.
4. Create a simple Flask/Django web app where users can query the listings or view a report.
5. Use Numpy for any property-related calculations (e.g., average price per square meter).

**TODO LIST**

1. Frontend Pagination
2. Numpy for Analysis
